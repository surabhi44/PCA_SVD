# PCA_SVD

Take any dataset (after reading their descriptions, make sure it has multiple variables) from https://www2.stetson.edu/~jrasp/data.htm. This website is created by Dr. John Rasp as a vast collection of datasets for students to try out their statistics methods. 

a) Find the Covariance matrix and Correlation matrix of this data matrix

b) Perform PCA/SVD, choose appropriate number(justify by a scree plot) of dimensions/principal components/singular values and find the new data matrix in terms of these dimensions.

c) Plot the scatter plot of this data along the first two dimensions (or three if it is possible)
